Daniel is a high school professor of plastic arts.

He would like to have a tool that allows him to get information about the dynamics of one of his classes, based on his students' transcripts.

The data that interest him most are :

    The name of the student who made the best progress (note Q1 <= note Q2 <= note Q3).
    The names of the three students with the highest overall averages of the year.
    The median and the quartiles (Q1, Q3) of his group.

The input data is the list of the students of the class, with for each the notes of the 3 quarters.

Taking into account any errors (note> 20, missing data, etc.) in the data will be a plus but is not obligatory. The test data does not contain any "traps".
